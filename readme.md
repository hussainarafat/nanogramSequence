Nanograms Sequence

Given a binary array (an list containing only 1s and 0s), return a list of positive integers that represent the lengths of the sets of consecutive 1's in the input array, in order from left to right.

Example:

    [1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1] => [3, 2]
    [1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1] => [1, 4]
    [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1] => [6]
    [1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1] => [1, 1, 2]
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] => []
